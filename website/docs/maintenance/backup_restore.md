title: Backup and Restore
---

## Backup

Create backup file `teslamate.bck`:

```bash
docker compose exec -T database pg_dump -U teslamate teslamate > /backuplocation/teslamate.bck
```

:::note
`-T` is important if you add this line a crontab or the backup will not work because docker will generate this error `the input device is not a TTY`
:::

:::note
Be absolutely certain to move the `teslamate.bck` file to another safe location, as you may lose that backup file if you use a docker-compose GUI to upgrade your teslamate configuration. Some GUIs delete the folder that holds the `docker-compose.yml` when updating.
:::

:::note
If you get the error `No such service: database`, update your _docker-compose.yml_ or use `db` instead of `database` in the above command.
:::

:::note
If you changed `TM_DB_USER` in the .env file from one of the advanced guides, make sure to replace the first instance of `teslamate` to the value of `TM_DB_USER` in the above command. 
:::

## Restore

:::note
Replace the default `teslamate` value below with the value defined in the .env file if you have one (TM_DB_USER and TM_DB_NAME)
:::

```bash
# Stop the teslamate container to avoid write conflicts
docker compose stop teslamate

# Drop existing data and reinitialize
docker compose exec -T database psql -U teslamate << .
drop schema public cascade;
create schema public;
create extension cube;
create extension earthdistance;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.ll_to_earth(float8, float8)
    RETURNS public.earth
    LANGUAGE SQL
    IMMUTABLE STRICT
    PARALLEL SAFE
    AS 'SELECT public.cube(public.cube(public.cube(public.earth()*cos(radians(\$1))*cos(radians(\$2))),public.earth()*cos(radians(\$1))*sin(radians(\$2))),public.earth()*sin(radians(\$1)))::public.earth';
.

# Restore
docker compose exec -T database psql -U teslamate -d teslamate < teslamate.bck

# Restart the teslamate container
docker compose start teslamate
```
