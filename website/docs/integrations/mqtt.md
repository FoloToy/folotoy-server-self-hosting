The MQTT function within TeslaMate allows useful values to be published to an MQTT broker. This is useful in allowing other automation platforms to consume data from TeslaMate.

## MQTT Topics

Vehicle data will be published to the following topics:

| Topic                                                  | Example              | Description                                                                           |
